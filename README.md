<p id ="myText"> My adventure with Python and Java started as a challenge during my studies of programming engineering, but thanks to determination and a change of perspective, it has become my strongest asset. I am fluent in English; my second language is Japanese, which I learned in Tokyo during a one-year course. I am passionate about cybersecurity, but my priority right now is to find a job as a Python or Java Developer. I am eager to use my technical skills and language experience to bring value to new projects. </p>
