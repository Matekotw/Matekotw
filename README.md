My adventure with Python and Java started as a challenge during my studies of programming engineering, but thanks to determination and a change of perspective, it becamemy strongest asset. I am fluent in English, my second language is Japanese, which Ilearned in Tokyo during a one-year course. I am passionate about cybersecurity, butmy priority right now is to find a job as a Python Developer or as a Java Developer. I am eager to use mytechnical skills and language experience to bring value to new projects.
